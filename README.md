# ssp-polynomial-time-solver
The program takes as input a set of elements put into a text file as "input.txt" and a target sum that gets inserted into the command line. The program goes through the set and sorts them in ascending order. Then it iterates through each element. Say that we have [2, 3, 5, 12] and our target sum is 15. We take the first element, which is 2. We check to see if it's smaller than the target sum. It is, therefore we add it with the next element, which is 3 and add it together. 2 + 3 = 5. We check to see if it's still smaller than the target sum, which still is, therefore we take the next element and add it with the sum, which is 5. So 5 + 5 = 10. It's still smaller than the target sum, therefore we take the sum and add it with the next element, which is 12. 10 + 12 = 22. This time, however, the sum is bigger than the target, therefore we take the element that we are on, which is 12 and do this. We take the target sum and subtract it with 12. So 15 - 12 = 3. We check every single element that's smaller than or equal to 3. We have the element 3. So 3 - 3 = 0. If the subtraction for the element 12 went to 0, then the output of the program will go "True". If for the element 12, the output wouldn't have gone to 0, so for example, it would have been 10 and the subtraction would be smaller than every single element in the set, then there would have been no subset that would fit for the element 12. If there were no other elements in the set that would fit this criteria, the output would be "False". The overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2 log n), due to the sorting algorithm and that we have to iterate through the array two times.
A video will be made shortly to explain this in more detail.
