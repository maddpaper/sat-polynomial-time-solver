# ssp-polynomial-time-solver
The program takes as input a set of elements put into a text file as "input.txt" and a target sum that gets inserted into the command line. The program goes through the set and sorts them in descending order. Then, first, it checks to see for any elements that are bigger than the target sum, or are equal to the target sum. If they're bigger, they get ignored. If they're equal, then the output will be equal to "True". We iterate through the elements, take the first element that's smaller than the target sum and it tries to add every single element to it to see if it reaches the target sum. So for example, for the set [5, 4, 3, 1] and the sum, 10, we would begin with 5 and try to add every element to it. 5 + 4 = 9. We check to see if it's bigger than the target sum. It's not, therefore we take 9 and add it with the next element, which is 3. 9 + 3 = 12. This time, it's bigger than the target sum, therefore 3 gets ignored and 9 gets added with 1. 9 + 1 = 10. Therefore the target sum has been reached and it will output to "True".
