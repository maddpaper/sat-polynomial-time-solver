Alright, so let's take the subset sum problem. Say that we take the set:

[3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2]

And let's say that we have a target sum of 30. First, we gotta sort the set in descending order. So it will look like:

[34, 12, 5, 4, 3, 2]

Now, we take the target sum, which is 30. We ignore every single element that's bigger than 30, so we will start at 12. If we have an element that's equal to the target sum, then the output will be "True", but it's not the case here so we'll move on. What we're gonna do is we'll take 12 and add it with every single element in the set and check if it's equal to the target sum. So we have 12 + 5 = 17, it's not equal to the sum, we will take 17, then move on to 4. 17 + 4 = 21, which is not equal to 30. 21 + 3 = 24. 24 + 2 = 26. It's less than 30, therefore the output will be "False". Now, let's take another example. We have the same set, but the target sum is 6. We ignore every single element in the array that's bigger than 6, so we will start with 5. We take 5, and first add it with 4. But as we can see, 5 + 4 = 9, which is bigger than 6. In that case, 4 gets ignored and we try adding 5 with 3 next. But 5+3 = 8, which is bigger than 6, therefore we ignore 3 and go for 2. 5 + 2 equals to 7 which is also bigger than 6. Therefore it gets ignored. If 5 added with every element didn't work out, then we'll go with the element that comes after 5, which is 4 and then add it with every single element in there. 4 + 3 = 7, which is bigger than 6, so it gets ignored. 4 + 2 = 6. Therefore the output will be "True".

Now, let's take the set:

[5, 4, 3, 2]

And the target sum is 10. We are gonna start from 5. 5 + 4 = 9. But this time, it's smaller than the target sum, so we will continue adding elements with 9. Next element is 3. 9 + 3 = 12, which is bigger than 10, therefore 3 gets ignored and we'll try with 2. 9 + 2 = 11, which is bigger than 10, therefore we have no successful sums for the element 5. We move on to the next element, which is 4. 4 + 3 = 7. Smaller than 10, we continue. 7 + 2 = 9. Smaller than 10. If for the current element that we are on, the sum of all elements that we added is smaller than the target sum, then the program will stop and output "False". If for the current element, if we add all elements to the current element would all be bigger than the target sum, then the output will run as "False".

Write the code in Python and make it so that you can input the arrays in a text file. Make it so that you input the arrays as 1 2 3 4 5 and not [1 2 3 4 5]. Tell me the time complexity of this program.
